      <h1>Biology: Genetics</h1>
      <p>
        Genetics is the study of heredity, focusing on how traits are passed
        from parents to offspring. It involves understanding DNA, genes, and the
        various patterns of inheritance that govern traits in living organisms.
      </p>

      <p><b>Basic Genetic Concepts</b></p>
      <p>
        Genes are segments of DNA that code for proteins, which determine an
        organism's traits. Each individual inherits two alleles for each
        geneâ€”one from each parent. The combination of these alleles influences
        characteristics such as eye color, height, and susceptibility to
        diseases.
      </p>

      <p>
        DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is structured as a double helix, composed of
        nucleotides, each containing a sugar, a phosphate group, and a
        nitrogenous base (adenine, thymine, cytosine, or guanine). The sequence
        of these bases forms the genetic code.
      </p>

      <p><b>Dominant and Recessive Traits</b></p>
      <p>
        Some traits follow simple Mendelian inheritance patterns, named after
        Gregor Mendel, the father of genetics. He discovered that some traits
        are dominant, meaning they are expressed if at least one dominant allele
        is present. Recessive traits, on the other hand, require two copies of
        the recessive allele to be expressed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Example:</b> In pea plants, the allele for tall height (T) is
          dominant over the allele for short height (t). A plant with TT or Tt
          will be tall, while only a plant with tt will be short.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Example:</b> In humans, the allele for brown eyes (B) is dominant
          over the allele for blue eyes (b), meaning a person with BB or Bb will
          have brown eyes, while only a person with bb will have blue eyes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Complex Inheritance Patterns</b></p>
      <p>
        Not all traits follow simple dominant-recessive patterns. More complex
        forms of inheritance include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Incomplete Dominance:</b> A blending of traits occurs when neither
          allele is completely dominant. <b>Example:</b> A red-flowered plant
          (RR) crossed with a white-flowered plant (WW) produces pink-flowered
          offspring (RW).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Codominance:</b> Both alleles are expressed equally.
          <b>Example:</b> In blood types, a person with the IA and IB alleles
          has type AB blood, showing both A and B antigens.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Multiple Alleles:</b> Some genes have more than two possible
          alleles. <b>Example:</b> The ABO blood group system includes three
          alleles: IA, IB, and i.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Polygenic Traits:</b> Traits controlled by multiple genes, leading
          to a range of phenotypes. <b>Example:</b> Human skin color and height
          are determined by several genes interacting together.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Sex-Linked Inheritance</b></p>
      <p>
        Some genes are located on the sex chromosomes (X and Y), leading to
        sex-linked inheritance. Since males have only one X chromosome (XY),
        they are more likely to express X-linked recessive traits.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Example:</b> Hemophilia, a blood clotting disorder, is more common
          in males because they only need one affected X chromosome to express
          the condition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Example:</b> Color blindness is also more common in males due to
          its X-linked recessive inheritance pattern.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Genetic Disorders and Mutations</b></p>
      <p>
        Mutations are changes in DNA that can lead to genetic disorders. Some
        disorders follow Mendelian inheritance, while others result from
        chromosomal abnormalities.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Sickle Cell Anemia:</b> A codominant disorder where abnormal
          hemoglobin leads to sickle-shaped red blood cells.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Down Syndrome:</b> Caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21
          (trisomy 21).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cystic Fibrosis:</b> A recessive disorder affecting the lungs and
          digestive system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy:</b> A sex-linked disorder that causes
          muscle degeneration and weakness.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Genetic Technologies and Ethics</b></p>
      <p>
        Advancements in genetic research have led to breakthroughs in medical
        science. Technologies such as CRISPR allow scientists to edit genes with
        precision, potentially curing genetic diseases. However, ethical
        concerns arise regarding genetic modification, cloning, and designer
        babies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding genetics allows scientists to develop treatments, predict
        genetic disorders, and explore new possibilities in medicine and
        biotechnology.
