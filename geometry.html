      <h1>Geometry: Circles</h1>
      <p>
        In geometry, a circle is one of the most fundamental shapes. It is
        defined as the set of all points in a plane that are at a fixed distance
        from a given point, called the center. The study of circles includes
        several important concepts and theorems that help in solving geometric
        problems. This article will cover the key aspects of circles that are
        typically taught in 10th grade geometry.
      </p>

      <h2>What is a Circle?</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>circle</strong> is a two-dimensional shape consisting of all
        points that are equidistant (at the same distance) from a fixed point
        called the <strong>center</strong>. The distance from the center to any
        point on the circle is called the <strong>radius</strong>. A line
        segment that passes through the center and touches the circle at two
        points is called a <strong>diameter</strong>.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Key Terms:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Center:</strong> The fixed point at the center of the circle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Radius:</strong> The distance from the center to any point on
          the circle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diameter:</strong> A line that passes through the center of
          the circle, touching the circle at two points.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Circumference:</strong> The distance around the edge of the
          circle.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Parts of a Circle</h2>
      <p>
        There are several important parts of a circle that we will learn about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Radius:</strong> A line segment from the center of the circle
          to any point on the circle. Its length is the radius of the circle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diameter:</strong> A line segment that passes through the
          center of the circle and touches the circle at two points. The
          diameter is twice the length of the radius. (Diameter = 2 × Radius).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Circumference:</strong> The perimeter or boundary of the
          circle. It is the total distance around the circle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chord:</strong> A line segment with both endpoints on the
          circle. The diameter is a special type of chord that passes through
          the center of the circle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Arc:</strong> A portion of the circumference of the circle. It
          can be measured in degrees or length.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sector:</strong> A region of the circle enclosed by two radii
          and the arc between them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Segment:</strong> A region of the circle enclosed by a chord
          and the arc it subtends.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Formulas for Circles</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding the basic formulas related to circles is crucial for
        solving geometry problems. Here are the essential formulas:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Circumference of a Circle</h3>
      <p>
        The circumference of a circle is the total distance around the circle,
        much like the perimeter of a polygon. It is the length of the boundary
        of the circle.
      </p>
      <p><strong>C = 2πr</strong> or <strong>C = πd</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> The formula for the circumference depends
        on the radius (r) or the diameter (d) of the circle.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>r</strong> is the radius of the circle (the distance from the
          center to any point on the circle).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>d</strong> is the diameter of the circle (the distance across
          the circle passing through the center, which is twice the length of
          the radius).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The formula <strong>C = 2πr</strong> is used when you know the radius,
        while <strong>C = πd</strong> is used when you know the diameter. Since
        <strong>d = 2r</strong>, both formulas are essentially the same. Pi (π)
        is approximately equal to 3.14159, and it is a constant that represents
        the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of any circle.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Area of a Circle</h3>
      <p>
        The area of a circle is the space enclosed within the boundary of the
        circle. It is essentially the amount of space inside the circle.
      </p>
      <p><strong>A = πr²</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> This formula calculates the area using the
        radius of the circle. The radius is squared (multiplied by itself), and
        then multiplied by pi (π).
      </p>
      <p><strong>r</strong> is the radius of the circle.</p>
      <p>
        The formula <strong>A = πr²</strong> allows you to calculate how much
        space is inside the circle. For example, if the radius of the circle is
        5 units, the area will be
        <strong>A = π(5)² = 25π ≈ 78.54</strong> square units.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Length of an Arc</h3>
      <p>
        The length of an arc is a portion of the circumference. It depends on
        the central angle that subtends the arc.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Length of Arc = (θ/360) × 2πr</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In this formula:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>θ</strong> is the central angle in degrees. This angle is
          formed by two radii extending from the center of the circle to the
          endpoints of the arc.
        </li>
        <li><strong>r</strong> is the radius of the circle.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The fraction <strong>θ/360</strong> represents the proportion of the
        circle that the arc covers. Since a full circle has 360 degrees, the
        fraction of the full circle covered by the arc is
        <strong>θ/360</strong>. Multiply this fraction by the full circumference
        of the circle (<strong>2πr</strong>) to get the length of the arc. For
        example, if the central angle is 90° (one-quarter of a circle) and the
        radius is 10 units, the length of the arc will be
        <strong>(90/360) × 2π(10) = π(10) = 31.42</strong> units.
      </p>

      <h2>Important Theorems and Properties of Circles</h2>
      <p>
        Several theorems and properties help in understanding the relationships
        between different parts of a circle. Some of the important ones are:
      </p>

      <h3>1. The Angle at the Center</h3>
      <p>
        If a central angle is formed by two radii, the angle at the center is
        equal to the angle subtended by the arc. The central angle determines
        the size of the arc.
      </p>

      <h3>2. The Angle at the Circumference</h3>
      <p>
        An angle formed by two chords that intersect at the circumference of the
        circle is half the angle at the center. This is known as the
        <strong>Angle at the Circumference Theorem</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Tangent and Radius</h3>
      <p>
        A tangent is a line that touches the circle at exactly one point. The
        important property of a tangent is that it is always perpendicular to
        the radius at the point of contact.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Chord Theorem</h3>
      <p>
        If two chords are equal in length, they are equidistant from the center
        of the circle.
      </p>

      <h2>Real-World Applications of Circles</h2>
      <p>Circles appear in many real-world situations. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Wheels:</strong> The wheels on vehicles are circular, and
          understanding the properties of circles helps in calculating the
          distance a wheel travels with each rotation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Design:</strong> Circles are commonly used in design, from
          logos to architectural layouts, where symmetry and proportions matter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Navigation:</strong> In navigation, the Earth is often treated
          as a circle when calculating distances between two points on the
          globe, especially for flight paths.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Circles are fundamental shapes in geometry with a variety of important
        properties and formulas. Understanding the basic concepts such as
        radius, diameter, circumference, and area is crucial for solving
        problems involving circles. With the knowledge of theorems and
        real-world applications, students can apply their understanding of
        circles in both academic and practical settings.
