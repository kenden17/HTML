        <h1>Unit 4: Political Geography</h1>
        <p>
          This unit focuses on the spatial expression of political power and how
          political boundaries, territories, and states are shaped by geography.
          It examines the political organization of space, state sovereignty,
          and the geopolitics that influence international relations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>1. The State and Its Components</h2>
        <p>
          A state is a politically organized territory with a permanent
          population, a defined territory, a government, and the ability to
          enter into relations with other states. States are the basic unit of
          political geography.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Territory:</strong> Defined geographical area controlled by
            a state.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sovereignty:</strong> The authority of a state to govern
            itself without external interference.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Recognition:</strong> The process by which a state is
            formally acknowledged by other states.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Types of States</h2>
        <p>
          States come in various forms based on their size, governance, and
          political affiliations.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Nation-State:</strong> A state where the boundaries of the
            nation and the state coincide (e.g., Japan, Iceland).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Multinational State:</strong> A state with multiple nations
            or ethnic groups (e.g., Canada, Russia).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stateless Nations:</strong> Ethnic groups that do not have
            their own independent state (e.g., the Kurds, Palestinians).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Microstates:</strong> Very small sovereign states (e.g.,
            Vatican City, Monaco).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Boundaries and Border Types</h2>
        <p>
          Political boundaries separate states and define their territorial
          limits. Boundaries can be classified into various types.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Physical Boundaries:</strong> Natural features like rivers,
            mountains, or oceans that serve as borders.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cultural Boundaries:</strong> Boundaries that reflect
            differences in culture, language, or religion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Geometric Boundaries:</strong> Straight lines drawn on maps,
            often without regard for physical or cultural features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Political Boundaries:</strong> Lines established through
            legal or political means, often as a result of treaties or
            negotiations.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Boundary Disputes</h2>
        <p>
          Boundaries are often contested due to historical, political, or

          <li>

        <p>
          Geopolitics involves the study of how geography affects global
          politics, power dynamics, and relationships between states.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Heartland Theory:</strong> Proposed by Halford Mackinder,
            this theory suggests that the control of the central Eurasian
            landmass (the Heartland) would lead to global dominance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rimland Theory:</strong> Nicholas Spykman’s theory that the
            coastal areas around Eurasia (the Rimland) are key to controlling
            the world.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>World-System Theory:</strong> Immanuel Wallerstein’s model
            dividing the world into the core, semi-periphery, and periphery,
            based on economic and political power.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Critical Geopolitics:</strong> The study of how geopolitical
            ideas are constructed and how they affect political decisions and
            international relations.

      <section>
        <h2>6. Supranationalism and Devolution</h2>
        <p>
          States may form supranational organizations for cooperation, or
          experience devolution as power is transferred to local levels.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Supranationalism:</strong> When multiple countries cooperate

          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Geographical Scale and Political Systems</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>8. Political Ecology</h2>
        <p>
          Political ecology examines the relationships between political,
          economic, and environmental factors, especially how these interactions
          affect resource distribution and management.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>

      <section>
        <h2>9. Political Boundaries and the Environment</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Unit 4 explores the role of political geography in shaping the modern
          world. Understanding state sovereignty, territorial boundaries,
          geopolitical theories, and global political systems is essential for
          analyzing power dynamics and international relations.
