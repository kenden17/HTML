        <h2>1. Introduction to Agriculture</h2>
        <p>
          Agriculture involves the cultivation of plants and the domestication
          of animals for food, fiber, medicinal plants, and other products used
          to sustain and enhance human life. The development of agriculture
          marked a major turning point in human history, leading to the
          establishment of permanent settlements and the rise of civilizations.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Subsistence Agriculture:</strong> This type of agriculture
            is focused on producing enough food to meet the needs of the
            farmer's family or community, with little surplus for trade.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Commercial Agriculture:</strong> In contrast, commercial
            agriculture involves large-scale production of crops and livestock
            for sale in the market. It is highly mechanized and often dependent
            on global markets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sustainable Agriculture:</strong> This approach seeks to
            balance the need for food production with environmental
            conservation, focusing on practices that protect natural resources
            and reduce pollution.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Types of Agriculture</h2>
        <p>
          Different regions and countries engage in various forms of
          agriculture, depending on climate, resources, culture, and economic
          factors. There are several key types of agriculture that dominate
          across the globe.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Shifting Cultivation:</strong> A type of subsistence
            agriculture where farmers clear forests or grasslands by burning
            vegetation and then plant crops for a few years before moving on to
            a new plot of land.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Intensive Subsistence Agriculture:</strong> Practiced in
            areas with high population densities, intensive subsistence farming
            involves the careful and labor-intensive cultivation of small land
            plots, often relying on rice or other staple crops.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pastoral Nomadism:</strong> A form of agriculture where
            herders move their animals (such as camels, cattle, or goats) to
            different areas for grazing, depending on seasonal changes and the
            availability of water and food.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Commercial Grain Farming:</strong> Involves the large-scale
            production of grains like wheat, corn, and barley, primarily for
            export to global markets. This form of agriculture is common in
            regions with temperate climates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Commercial Livestock Farming:</strong> This involves raising
            animals, such as cattle, pigs, and poultry, for meat production on a
            large scale. Commercial livestock farming is often highly
            industrialized and mechanized.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mixed Crop and Livestock Farming:</strong> A farming system
            where both crops and livestock are raised on the same farm. This
            method is often used to diversify income sources and reduce risk
            from crop failure.
          </li>
        </ul>

          the mid-20th century that significantly increased food production
          worldwide, particularly in developing countries. These innovations
          included the development of high-yielding varieties of crops, chemical
          fertilizers, pesticides, and advanced irrigation techniques.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>High-Yield Varieties:</strong> The development of
            genetically modified or selectively bred crop varieties that are
            resistant to diseases, pests, and environmental stresses, leading to
            higher crop yields.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mechanization:</strong> The introduction of machinery, such
            as tractors, harvesters, and plows, which revolutionized farming
            practices and allowed for more efficient production.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Irrigation:</strong> The development of irrigation systems
            that allowed farmers to grow crops in areas with insufficient
            rainfall.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fertilizers and Pesticides:</strong> The use of chemical
            fertilizers to boost soil fertility and pesticides to protect crops
            from pests and diseases. While these innovations increased food
            production, they also led to environmental concerns.
