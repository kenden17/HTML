        <h1>Unit 5: Cell Division</h1>
        <p>
          Cell division is the process by which cells reproduce and make copies
          of themselves. It plays a critical role in growth, development,
          repair, and reproduction. This unit explores the cell cycle, mitosis,
          and meiosis in detail.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>1. The Cell Cycle</h2>
        <p>
          The cell cycle is the series of events that cells go through as they
          grow and divide. It is made up of interphase and the mitotic phase (M
          phase).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>G1 Phase:</strong> Cell grows and performs normal functions.
          </li>
          <li><strong>S Phase:</strong> DNA is replicated (copied).</li>
          <li>
            <strong>G2 Phase:</strong> Cell prepares for division by producing
            proteins and organelles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>M Phase:</strong> Includes mitosis and cytokinesis (actual
            cell division).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Mitosis</h2>
        <p>
          Mitosis is the process by which a cell divides its nucleus and
          produces two genetically identical daughter cells. It is used for
          growth, repair, and asexual reproduction.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Prophase:</strong> Chromosomes condense and become visible;
            spindle fibers form; nuclear envelope breaks down.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Metaphase:</strong> Chromosomes line up in the middle of the
            cell.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Anaphase:</strong> Sister chromatids are pulled apart to
            opposite ends of the cell.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Telophase:</strong> Nuclear envelopes reform; chromosomes
            uncoil.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After mitosis, <strong>cytokinesis</strong> occurs, splitting the
          cytoplasm and forming two separate cells.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Regulation of the Cell Cycle</h2>
        <p>
          The cell cycle is tightly controlled by regulatory proteins and
          checkpoints. If regulation fails, it can lead to uncontrolled cell
          division, also known as cancer.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Checkpoints:</strong> Occur at G1, G2, and M phases to
            ensure proper division.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Apoptosis:</strong> Programmed cell death that occurs if
            cells are damaged beyond repair.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Meiosis</h2>
        <p>
          Meiosis is a type of cell division that produces four genetically
          different gametes (sperm or egg cells) with half the number of
          chromosomes. It is essential for sexual reproduction.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Meiosis I:</strong> Homologous chromosomes separate.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Meiosis II:</strong> Sister chromatids separate (similar to
            mitosis).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Key differences from mitosis include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Crossing Over:</strong> In Prophase I, homologous
            chromosomes exchange genetic material, increasing genetic variation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Independent Assortment:</strong> Random distribution of
            chromosomes increases diversity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Result:</strong> Four haploid cells that are genetically
            unique.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Cell division allows organisms to grow, repair damage, and reproduce.
          Mitosis ensures genetic consistency in body cells, while meiosis
          introduces genetic diversity for sexual reproduction. Proper
          regulation of the cell cycle is essential to prevent diseases like
          cancer.
