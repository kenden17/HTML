        <h1>Unit 2: Chemistry of Life</h1>
        <p>
          Understanding biology requires a foundation in basic chemistry because
          all living things are composed of matter and undergo chemical
          processes. This unit explores the structure of atoms, the nature of
          chemical bonds, the properties of water, and the role of biomolecules
          in life.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Matter and Atoms</h2>
        <p>
          All matter is made up of atoms, which are the smallest units of
          elements that retain their properties. An atom consists of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Protons</strong> (positive charge) — found in the nucleus
          </li>
          <li><strong>Neutrons</strong> (no charge) — also in the nucleus</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Electrons</strong> (negative charge) — orbit the nucleus
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The atomic number equals the number of protons. Atoms of the same
          element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Chemical Bonds</h2>
        <p>
          Atoms form chemical bonds to achieve stability. There are three main
          types of bonds:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Ionic Bonds:</strong> Electrons are transferred from one
            atom to another, creating charged ions that attract each other
            (e.g., NaCl).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Covalent Bonds:</strong> Electrons are shared between atoms
            (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>O).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hydrogen Bonds:</strong> Weak bonds between polar molecules,
            especially important in water and DNA structure.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Properties of Water</h2>
        <p>
          Water is essential for life and has unique properties due to its
          polarity:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Cohesion:</strong> Water molecules stick to each other.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adhesion:</strong> Water molecules stick to other surfaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>High specific heat:</strong> Water resists temperature
            changes, helping to regulate climate and body temperature.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Solvent properties:</strong> Water dissolves many
            substances, making it the “universal solvent.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ice density:</strong> Ice floats because it's less dense
            than liquid water, insulating aquatic life in winter.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Acids, Bases, and pH</h2>
        <p>The pH scale measures how acidic or basic a solution is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Acids:</strong> pH less than 7; produce H<sup>+</sup> ions
            in solution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bases:</strong> pH greater than 7; produce OH<sup>−</sup>
            ions.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Neutral:</strong> pH of 7; pure water.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Living organisms use buffers to maintain stable pH levels, essential
          for enzyme activity and cellular function.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Macromolecules of Life</h2>
        <p>Life relies on four main types of carbon-based macromolecules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Provide energy and structure. Made
            of sugars (monosaccharides). Example: glucose, starch, cellulose.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lipids:</strong> Store energy and make up cell membranes.
            Includes fats, oils, and waxes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proteins:</strong> Made of amino acids; used for structure,
            enzymes, transport, and signaling.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Nucleic Acids:</strong> DNA and RNA, which store and
            transmit genetic information. Made of nucleotides.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Enzymes and Biochemical Reactions</h2>
        <p>
          Enzymes are proteins that speed up chemical reactions by lowering
          activation energy. They are highly specific to the substrates they act
          on.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Active site:</strong> The region where the enzyme binds to
            the substrate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enzyme-substrate complex:</strong> Temporary binding that
            facilitates the reaction.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Enzyme activity is affected by temperature, pH, and substrate
          concentration. Enzymes are essential for digestion, energy production,
          and more.
        </p>
