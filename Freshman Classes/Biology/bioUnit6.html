        <h1>Unit 6: Genetics</h1>
        <p>
          Genetics is the study of heredity — how traits are passed from parents
          to offspring. In this unit, students explore the foundational
          principles of inheritance, the structure and function of DNA, and the
          role of genes in determining physical and behavioral characteristics.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>1. Mendelian Genetics</h2>
        <p>
          Gregor Mendel, known as the "Father of Genetics," used pea plants to
          discover the basic principles of heredity. He identified dominant and
          recessive traits and formulated the Laws of Inheritance:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Law of Segregation:</strong> Each individual has two alleles
            for each gene, which separate during gamete formation. Each gamete
            receives one allele.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Law of Independent Assortment:</strong> Genes for different
            traits are inherited independently of each other.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Key terms include genotype (genetic makeup), phenotype (physical
          traits), homozygous (two identical alleles), and heterozygous (two
          different alleles).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Punnett Squares and Probability</h2>
        <p>
          Punnett squares are tools used to predict the probability of offspring
          inheriting particular traits. They help visualize genotype
          combinations and calculate ratios of expected phenotypes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students use Punnett squares for monohybrid (one trait) and dihybrid
          (two traits) crosses. These exercises reinforce understanding of
          dominant/recessive relationships and probability in genetics.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. DNA and the Structure of Genes</h2>
        <p>
          DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that contains the genetic
          instructions for living organisms. It is composed of two strands
          forming a double helix, made up of nucleotides:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Adenine (A)</li>
          <li>Thymine (T)</li>
          <li>Cytosine (C)</li>
          <li>Guanine (G)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A pairs with T, and C pairs with G. Genes are specific sequences of
          DNA that code for proteins. Chromosomes are long strands of DNA, and
          humans typically have 23 pairs.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Inheritance Patterns Beyond Mendel</h2>
        <p>
          Not all traits follow Mendelian inheritance. This unit introduces:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Incomplete Dominance:</strong> A blend of traits (e.g., red
            + white = pink flowers).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Codominance:</strong> Both alleles are expressed equally
            (e.g., AB blood type).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Multiple Alleles:</strong> More than two allele options
            exist for a gene (e.g., blood types A, B, O).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Polygenic Traits:</strong> Traits controlled by many genes
            (e.g., skin color, height).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Mutations and Genetic Disorders</h2>
        <p>Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence. They can be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Point Mutations:</strong> One base is substituted for
            another.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Frameshift Mutations:</strong> Insertions or deletions that
            alter the reading frame of a gene.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Some mutations are harmless, while others can lead to genetic
          disorders like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Genetic Technology</h2>
        <p>The unit concludes with modern applications of genetics, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Genetic Engineering:</strong> Direct manipulation of an
            organism’s genes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CRISPR:</strong> A precise gene-editing tool used in
            research and medicine.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>DNA Fingerprinting:</strong> Identifying individuals based
            on their unique DNA sequences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gene Therapy:</strong> Treating genetic diseases by
            inserting healthy genes.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Genetics is a critical part of biology that connects all living things
          through heredity. By understanding genes, alleles, DNA, and
          inheritance patterns, students gain insight into both the
          predictability and complexity of life. This unit lays the groundwork
          for future exploration of molecular biology, biotechnology, and
          evolution.
