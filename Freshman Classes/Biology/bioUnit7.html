        <h1>Unit 7: Evolution</h1>
        <p>
          Evolution is the process by which populations of organisms change over
          generations through variations in traits and natural selection. This
          unit explores the evidence for evolution, mechanisms that drive it,
          and the contributions of key scientists like Charles Darwin.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>1. Early Ideas About Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          Before Darwin, scientists like Lamarck proposed that organisms could
          change during their lifetimes and pass those traits on. However,
          Lamarck's idea of acquired traits was later disproven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Charles Darwin introduced the concept of natural selection after
          observing species, especially during his travels to the Galápagos
          Islands. His book, <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, provided strong
          evidence for evolution.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Natural Selection</h2>
        <p>
          Natural selection is the process where individuals with favorable
          traits are more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, these
          traits become more common in the population.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Variation:</strong> Individuals in a population vary in
            their traits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Overproduction:</strong> More offspring are produced than
            can survive.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Competition:</strong> Offspring compete for limited
            resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adaptation:</strong> Traits that improve survival and
            reproduction become more common.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Evidence of Evolution</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Fossil Record:</strong> Shows changes in species over time
            and transitional forms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Comparative Anatomy:</strong> Similar structures
            (homologous) suggest common ancestry.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Embryology:</strong> Early development of organisms shows
            shared traits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Molecular Biology:</strong> DNA and protein similarities
            show genetic relationships.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Biogeography:</strong> Geographic distribution of species
            supports evolutionary history.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Mechanisms of Evolution</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Mutation:</strong> Random changes in DNA can introduce new
            traits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gene Flow:</strong> Movement of genes between populations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Genetic Drift:</strong> Random changes in allele frequency,
            especially in small populations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Natural Selection:</strong> Non-random increase of
            advantageous traits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sexual Selection:</strong> Traits that improve mating
            success become more common.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Speciation</h2>
        <p>
          Speciation is the formation of new species. It occurs when populations
          become isolated and evolve separately.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Geographic Isolation:</strong> Physical barriers prevent
            populations from interbreeding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reproductive Isolation:</strong> Differences in mating
            behavior or timing prevent breeding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adaptive Radiation:</strong> One species evolves into many
            different forms to adapt to various environments.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Evolution in Action</h2>
        <p>
          Evolution is observable today in examples like antibiotic resistance
          in bacteria or changes in animal traits due to environmental pressure.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Peppered Moth:</strong> Color change due to industrial
            pollution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Darwin’s Finches:</strong> Beak size changes based on food
            availability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>MRSA Bacteria:</strong> Resistance to antibiotics due to
            rapid evolution.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Misconceptions About Evolution</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>"Evolution is just a theory":</strong> In science, a theory
            is a well-tested explanation with strong evidence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>"Individuals evolve":</strong> Evolution occurs in
            populations, not individuals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>"Evolution has a goal":</strong> Evolution does not aim for
            perfection—it's driven by survival and reproduction.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Evolution explains the diversity of life on Earth. Through mechanisms
          like natural selection, mutation, and genetic drift, populations
          change over time. Evidence from fossils, DNA, and anatomy supports the
          theory of evolution. Understanding evolution helps us explain how
          species adapt and survive in a changing world.
