      <p>
        <strong>Substinance Agricultre</strong> is farming to feed yoursef
        and/or your town. This is not to make profit. Some methods of farming
        can be intensive or non-intesnive, slash and burn, and pastoral
        nomadism. <br /><strong>Commercial Agricultre</strong> is farming to
        make a profit by selling crops on the market. Some methods of farming
        include intensive, and plantations. <br /><strong>Rice Farming</strong>
        has many different ways that it is practiced. It can be substinance or
        intensive. It can be hard to distinguish the two because they are both
        common practice in LDC's.
