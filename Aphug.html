      <p>
        Agricultre is practiced in many different ways. This can vary depending
        on where you are and the economic level of your country. The two main
        types are:

        -Commercial Agriculture
      </ol>

      <p>
        <strong>Substinance Agricultre</strong> is farming to feed yoursef
        and/or your town. This is not to make profit. Some methods of farming
        can be intensive or non-intesnive, slash and burn, and pastoral
        nomadism. <br /><strong>Commercial Agricultre</strong> is farming to
        make a profit by selling crops on the market. Some methods of farming
        include intensive, and plantations.

      <h2 id="ricefarming">Rice Farming</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Rice Farming</strong>
        has many different ways that it is practiced. It can be substinance or
        intensive. It can be hard to distinguish the two because they are both
        common practice in LDC's. A common way to tell is the use of space. If
        it seems that there is a systematic way to farming, then it is likely
        intensive. But, on the other hand, substinance (non-intensive) rice
        farming often has wild rice patteis with no rows or order.
      </p>
      <h2 id="plantations">Plantations</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Plantations</strong> are a type of intensive, commerical farming
        producing cash crops. These are typically found in LDC's or wherever
        large scale labor is cheap. So crops include, but are not limited to;
        cotton, rubber, coffee, coca beans, jute, sugarcane, and bananas.
