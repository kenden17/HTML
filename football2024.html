      <h2>Season Recap</h2>
      <p>
        The 2024 football season was a breakthrough year. I pushed myself to new
        limits as a starting running back, improving speed, strength, and game
        awareness. Every game was an opportunity to grow and rise to the
        standards of highschool athletics.
      </p>
      <p>
        From morning lifts to summer practices, the season was built on grit,
        discipline, and relentless effort. The journey has only just begun.

      <h2>Film & Practice Notes</h2>
      <p>
        Studying game footage helped me recognize gaps in my decision making.
        Practice was where theory turned into instinct - to make the X's and O's
        in the playbook into real time execution.
