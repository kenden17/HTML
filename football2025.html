      <h2>Season Recap</h2>
      <p>
        The 2025 football season was a year of self doubt and overcoming
        obsticles. This season, as a sophmore, expectations were high. As the
        season began, I was playing JV. But, due to injuries and personel
        changes, I was pulled up to start on varsity as a safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Late nights of studying, early mornings of lifting, and everything
        inbetween, this season took out working the unmotivated.

        New playbook = study. Study. Study. Be so sure of assignments that on
        the field it becomes automatic. 100 mph every play. No plays off. No
        plays unlearned. No plays forgotten.
