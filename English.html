      <h1>English: Conjunctions</h1>
      <p>
        Conjunctions are an essential part of grammar that link words, phrases,
        or clauses together, helping sentences to flow smoothly and convey
        complex ideas. Understanding conjunctions and their various types can
        significantly improve both writing and speech by adding clarity and
        coherence. This article explores every kind of conjunction in detail,
        offering examples and explanations for each.
      </p>

      <h2>What are Conjunctions?</h2>
      <p>
        Conjunctions are words that connect words, phrases, clauses, or
        sentences. Their role is to establish relationships between these
        components. Conjunctions allow for smoother communication by showing
        connections, such as cause and effect, contrast, and time relationships.
      </p>
      <p>There are three primary types of conjunctions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Coordinating Conjunctions</li>
        <li>Subordinating Conjunctions</li>
        <li>Correlative Conjunctions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let’s dive into each type.</p>

      <h2>1. Coordinating Conjunctions</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Definition:</strong><br />
        Coordinating conjunctions are used to link individual words, phrases, or
        independent clauses that are of equal importance or similar in
        structure. These conjunctions join elements that are grammatically equal
        in a sentence. There are only seven coordinating conjunctions in
        English, often remembered by the acronym <strong>FANBOYS</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>For</strong></li>
        <li><strong>And</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Nor</strong></li>
        <li><strong>But</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Or</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Yet</strong></li>
        <li><strong>So</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>For</strong>: "I was tired, <em>for</em> I had worked all
          day." (The conjunction "for" is used to show the reason for the
          previous statement.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>And</strong>: "She likes reading books, <em>and</em> she
          enjoys writing too." (The conjunction "and" is used to connect two
          similar actions.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nor</strong>: "He did not sing, <em>nor</em> did he dance."
          (The conjunction "nor" is used to connect two negative clauses.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>But</strong>: "I wanted to go to the party, <em>but</em> I was
          too tired." (The conjunction "but" is used to show contrast.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Or</strong>: "Do you want tea <em>or</em> coffee?" (The
          conjunction "or" is used to present a choice.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Yet</strong>: "He studied hard, <em>yet</em> he failed the
          test." (The conjunction "yet" introduces a contrast.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>So</strong>: "It was raining, <em>so</em> we stayed indoors."
          (The conjunction "so" shows cause and effect.)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Subordinating Conjunctions</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Definition:</strong><br />
        Subordinating conjunctions connect a dependent clause (also known as a
        subordinate clause) to an independent clause. These conjunctions are
        used to indicate relationships like time, cause, condition, contrast,
        and place between the two clauses. Some common subordinating
        conjunctions include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Although</li>
        <li>Because</li>
        <li>Since</li>
        <li>If</li>
        <li>Unless</li>
        <li>While</li>
        <li>Before</li>
        <li>After</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Although</strong>: "Although it was raining, we went for a
          walk." (Shows contrast.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Because</strong>: "She passed the test <em>because</em> she
          studied hard." (Shows cause and effect.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Since</strong>: "We haven't seen her <em>since</em> last
          summer." (Shows time.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>If</strong>: "I will go to the party <em>if</em> I finish my
          homework." (Shows condition.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unless</strong>: "You will fail the test <em>unless</em> you
          study." (Shows condition.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>While</strong>: "I was reading a book <em>while</em> waiting
          for my friend." (Shows time.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Before</strong>: "I will call you <em>before</em> I leave."
          (Shows time.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>After</strong>: "She arrived <em>after</em> I had left."
          (Shows time.)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Correlative Conjunctions</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Definition:</strong><br />
        Correlative conjunctions are pairs of conjunctions that work together to
        connect equivalent elements. They are used to highlight a relationship
        between words or phrases in a balanced manner. Some common correlative
        conjunctions include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Both...and</li>
        <li>Either...or</li>
        <li>Neither...nor</li>
        <li>Not only...but also</li>
        <li>Whether...or</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Both...and</strong>: "She is <em>both</em> smart
          <em>and</em> hardworking." (Shows equality between two qualities.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Either...or</strong>: "You can <em>either</em> stay here
          <em>or</em> come with me." (Offers a choice.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Neither...nor</strong>: "He is <em>neither</em> tall
          <em>nor</em> short." (Shows the absence of two qualities.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Not only...but also</strong>: "She is <em>not only</em> a
          talented singer <em>but also</em> a great dancer." (Emphasizes both
          qualities.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Whether...or</strong>: "I don’t know <em>whether</em> we
          should go to the beach <em>or</em> the mountains." (Presents two
          alternatives.)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Conjunctions are vital for creating clear, coherent, and well-structured
        sentences. By understanding and using the different types of
        conjunctions—coordinating, subordinating, and correlative—you can
        improve your writing by linking ideas more effectively. Whether you're
        forming simple compound sentences or constructing complex thoughts,
        conjunctions help make your communication smoother and more precise.
