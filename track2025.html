      <h2>Season Recap</h2>
      <p>
        The 2025 track season was a chance to learn and grow individually. As a
        freshman my goal was to make a permenant spot for me on the team for the
        years to come. And by winning freshman of the year as well as a varsity
        letter, I can say that I achieved my goal.
      </p>
      <p>This season took everything I could give.</p>

          <p>
            Sprinting will help me get to the next level in all sports, so off
            season training must be as rigorous as in season.

      <h2>Growth for the Future</h2>
      <p>
        This season was decent for me, but I need to separate myself from the
        top sprinters in the conference. In the future they are only going to
        get faster, and that means I am going to have to outwork them every
        single day. The moment knows.
