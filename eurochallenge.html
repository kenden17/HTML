      <h2>For the Future</h2>
      <p>
        The beginning of any good team is recruiting. We need to recruit some of the most motiviated and driven students in the school. Second we need more preperation. We need to all be not only on the same page, but the same word on the same line. We are only as strong as our weakest link.
